### 4. Travelling Salesman Problem (Nearest Neighbor)

This program implements the Nearest Neighbor heuristic for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). It starts from an arbitrary city and repeatedly visits the nearest unvisited city until all cities have been visited, then returns to the starting city.

**Code:**

```python
def nearest_neighbor_tsp(dist):
    n = len(dist)
    tour = [0]
    visited = {0}
    total = 0
    curr = 0

    while len(visited) < n:
        nxt, d = min(
            ((j, dist[curr][j]) for j in range(n) if j not in visited),
            key=lambda x: x[1]
        )
        tour.append(nxt)
        visited.add(nxt)
        total += d
        curr = nxt

    tour.append(0)
    total += dist[curr][0]
    return tour, total

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    distances = [
        [0, 4, 8, 9, 12],
        [4, 0, 6, 8, 9],
        [8, 6, 0, 10, 11],
        [9, 8, 10, 0, 7],
        [12, 9, 11, 7, 0]
    ]
    tour, total = nearest_neighbor_tsp(distances)
    print("Nearest Neighbor TSP Tour:", tour)
    print("Total Distance:", total)
