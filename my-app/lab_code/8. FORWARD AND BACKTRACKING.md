### 10. Forward & Backward Chaining

This program demonstrates two fundamental inference mechanisms in AI: Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining.

- **Forward Chaining:** Starts with known facts and applies rules to derive new facts until the goal is reached or no more facts can be derived.
- **Backward Chaining:** Starts with the goal and works backward, looking for rules that could prove the goal, until it reduces the goal to known facts or subgoals that can be proven.

**Code:**

```python

        facts (set): Initial set of known facts.
