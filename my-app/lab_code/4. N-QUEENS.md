### 5. N-Queens Problem (Only 1 Solution)

This program solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm to find *one* valid solution. It attempts to place queens row by row, checking for safety (no other queen in the same column or diagonal) at each step. If a queen cannot be placed in a row, it backtracks.

**Code:**

```python
# N - Queens Problem (Only 1 solution)

def is_safe(board, row, col):
    """
    Check if it's safe to place a queen at board[row][col].
    A queen is safe if no other queen is in the same column,
    or on the same upper-left or upper-right diagonal.
    """
    n = len(board)

    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1
        j -= 1

    # Check upper diagonal on right side
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j < n:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1
        j += 1

    return True

def solve_queens(board, row):
    """
    Recursively solves the N-Queens Problem using backtracking.
    Attempts to place a queen in the current row.
    """
    n = len(board)

    # Base case: If all queens are placed, return True
    if row >= n:
        return True

    # Try placing a queen in each column of the current row
    for col in range(n):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            board[row][col] = 1 # Place the queen

            # Recur to place the rest of the queens
            if solve_queens(board, row + 1):
                return True

            # If placing queen at board[row][col] doesn't lead to a solution, backtrack
            board[row][col] = 0 # Remove the queen

    return False # No solution found for this row

def print_board(board):
    """Prints the board configuration."""
    n = len(board)

        for j in range(n):
            print(board[i][j], end=" ")
        print() # New line after each row
    print() # Additional new line for separation

    """
    n = 8 # Size of the chessboard (8x8)
    board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)] # Initialize empty board

    if solve_queens(board, 0):
        print("Solution found:")
        print_board(board)
    else:
        print("No solution exists.")

### 6. N-Queens Problem (All Possible Solutions)

This program extends the N-Queens solver to find *all* possible solutions. Instead of returning `True` after finding the first solution, it continues to explore other possibilities by backtracking, and stores each complete valid configuration in a list.

**Code:**

```python
# N - Queens Problem (All possible solutions)

def is_safe(board, row, col):
    """
    Check if it's safe to place a queen at board[row][col].
    A queen is safe if no other queen is in the same column,
    or on the same upper-left or upper-right diagonal.
    """
    n = len(board)

    # Check column
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1
        j -= 1

    # Check upper diagonal on right side
    i, j = row, col
    while i >= 0 and j < n:
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
        i -= 1
