### 7. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This program implements a simple interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. It includes functions to print the board, check for a win condition (rows, columns, diagonals), and determine if the board is full (tie game).

**Code:**

```python
# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

def print_board(board):
    """Prints the current state of the Tic-Tac-Toe board."""
    print()
    for row in board:
        print(" | ".join(row))
        print("-" * 9)
    print()

def check_winner(board, player):
    """Checks if the specified player has won the game."""
    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if all(cell == player for cell in row):
            return True

    # Check columns
    for col in range(3):
        if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
            return True

    # Check main diagonal
    if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)):
        return True

    # Check anti-diagonal
    if all(board[i][2 - i] == player for i in range(3)):
        return True

    return False

def is_full(board):
    """Checks if the board is completely filled (tie game)."""
    return all(cell != ' ' for row in board for cell in row)

def tic_tac_toe():
    """Main function to run the Tic-Tac-Toe game."""
    board = [[' ' for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    current_player = 'X'

    while True:
        print_board(board)
        print(f"Player {current_player}'s turn.")

        try:
            row = int(input("Enter row (1-3): ")) - 1
            col = int(input("Enter column (1-3): ")) - 1
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid input! Please enter a number between 1 and 3.")
            continue

        if not (0 <= row < 3 and 0 <= col < 3):
            print("Invalid row/column. Please enter values between 1 and 3.")
            continue

        if board[row][col] == ' ':
            board[row][col] = current_player
        else:
            print("Invalid move! That spot is already taken. Try again.")
            continue

        # Check if the current player has won
        if check_winner(board, current_player):
            print_board(board)
            print(f"Player {current_player} wins!")
            break

        # Check if the board is full (tie game)
        if is_full(board):
            print_board(board)
            print("It's a tie!")
            break

        # Switch to the other player
        current_player = 'O' if current_player == 'X' else 'X'

    tic_tac_toe()
