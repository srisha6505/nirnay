### 8. A* Algorithm

This program implements the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a `Node` class to store state information, and calculates `f = g + h` where `g` is the cost from the start node and `h` is a heuristic estimate to the goal. A `PriorityQueue` (simulated with `heapq`) is used to always explore the node with the lowest `f` value.

**Code:**

```python
import heapq
import math # For math.inf

# A* Algorithm

class Node:
    def __init__(self, state, parent=None, action=None, cost=0, heuristic=0):
        self.state = state          # Current state in the search space
        self.parent = parent        # Parent node
        self.action = action        # Action that led to this node from the parent node
        self.cost = cost            # Cost to reach this node from the start node (g)
        self.heuristic = heuristic  # Heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal (h)

    def __lt__(self, other):
        # Define less-than operator for PriorityQueue comparison (based on f = g + h)
        return (self.cost + self.heuristic) < (other.cost + other.heuristic)
